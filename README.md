# Beta-Release of PK-Sim 10 and MoBi 10
Dear OSP users, 

We are happy to announce that the new Version 10 of PK-Sim and MoBi is now available for beta-testing. The beta-test phase will last untill the **end of August**.
The goal of the beta release is to give you an opportunity to test the new features and to let us know if you have any problems or feedback regarding the new implementation.

## How can you test the new features?
You can use the *portable versions* of PK-Sim and MoBi  (download links below). The portable versions do not require installation and can be used in parallel to the official OSP Suite 9.

Your feedback on the new features is highly welcome.

**Important**: The beta-test versions are not final released of the software packages: please use them for testing purposes only, but not for productive work.

## New features

### Modeling of Protein expressions in PK-Sim redesigned and extended
See the [documentation](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/v/v10/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/pk-sim-expression-data) for details.

* More flexible protein localization settings
  * Enzymes/Binding partners (**BP**): introduction of **fraction expressed** in different compartments
  * Transporters: introduction of **fraction expressed apical/basolateral** (Kidney/Liver/GI) and **fraction expressed blood brain barrier/tissue** (brain)
* Introduction of **Initial Protein Concentration** as explicit parameter

See [Localizations and initial concentrations of enzymes](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/v/v10/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/pk-sim-expression-data#localizations-and-initial-concentrations-of-enzymes) and [Localizations, directions, and initial concentrations of transport proteins](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/v/v10/working-with-pk-sim/pk-sim-documentation/pk-sim-expression-data#localizations-directions-and-initial-concentrations-of-transport-proteins) for the detailed description.

*  New transporter types:

  * Plasma <=> Blood Cells
  * Plasma <=> Interstitial
  * Bidirectional

* Transport direction (Influx/Efflux/â€¦) can be set in each organ independently

### Observed data import in PK-Sim and MoBi redesigned and extended

See the [documentation](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/v/v10/shared-tools-and-example-workflows/import-edit-observed-data) for details.

* Better support for "Nonmem like" data formats (s. [Supported Formats](https://docs.open-systems-pharmacology.org/v/v10/shared-tools-and-example-workflows/import-edit-observed-data#supported-formats))

* Fully redesigned user interface
